Pygmy REV B
(c) Matteo Golin, 2025

This shell allows you to configure the Pygmy flight computer with new settings
before a flight. Make sure that once you've made changes, you save them to the
Pygmy's on-board memory using the 'save' command. Once saved, you can start the
flight computer with your new settings by sending the 'reboot' command.

COMMANDS:
    
    help        Display this help text.
    reboot      Reboot the Pygmy.
    save        Save newly configured settings to the Pygmy's EEPROM (memory).
